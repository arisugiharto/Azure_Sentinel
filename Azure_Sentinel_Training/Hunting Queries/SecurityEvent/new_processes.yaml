name: New processes observed in last 24 hours
description: |
  'These new processes could be benign new programs installed on hosts; however, especially in normally stable environments, 
  these new processes could provide an indication of an unauthorized/malicious binary that has been installed and run. 
  Reviewing the wider context of the logon sessions in which these binaries ran can provide a good starting point for identifying possible attacks.'
